    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Classic Italian-American lasagna is typically cooked in a casserole dish with the long, thick, wide pasta noodles
        of the same name,
        laid out and topped with oodles of cheese, layers of sauce and lots of meat. Lasagna soup, however, cleverly
        brings the same ingredients together in an easy-to-make one-pot meal.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground beef</li>
        <li>Italian sausage</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Chicken broth</li>
        <li>Heavy cream</li>
        <li>Marinara sauce</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>Parmesan</li>
        <li>Mozarella</li>
        <li>Basil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by heating olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally,
            until the color has faded, about 7 minutes. Stir in the garlic and saut√© for 1 minute.
            Next, add the beef, Italian sausage, salt, pepper and red pepper flakes, if you want a little heat. Cook the
            meat, breaking it up with a spoon, until there are no pink spots left.</li>
        <li>Stir in your favorite marinara sauce, then add chicken broth and heavy cream and
            bring to a boil. Once the soup is boiling, add the lasagna noodles and cook until tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Remove from heat and stir in the Parmesan and mozzarella cheeses until melted. Top with basil.</li>
    </ol>
